Completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate has allowed me to gain knowledge of networking protocols and basic Python scripting, understanding of threat analysis and vulnerability management, and familiarity with cybersecurity tools. I have also been able to practice using tools like tcpdump, Wireshark, Suricata, Chronicle, Splunk, and VirusTotal. I would be able to apply the knowledge that I have gained through my certification studies to monitoring and analyzing security events using SIEM tools, investigating potential security incidents, and documenting processes, findings, and resolutions.
